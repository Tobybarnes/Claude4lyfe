# What Gets Preserved When You Move Machines

## The Relationship 🤝

Everything that makes our working relationship feel natural and efficient transfers:

### 1. **How We Talk**
- ✅ **Auto memory** - I remember your patterns, preferences, and our working style
  - Location: `~/.claude/projects/[dir]/memory/MEMORY.md`
  - Contains learned patterns from our conversations
  - Loads automatically when you work in that directory

### 2. **Your Tools** 🎯
- ✅ **22 custom skills** - All your productivity workflows
  - `/newday` - Morning routine
  - `/weekly-update` - Design team updates
  - `/gsd` - Proposal reviews
  - `/journal-entry` - Career memos
  - `/log-signal` - Strategic observations
  - `/meeting-notes` - Process transcripts
  - `/publish` - Weekly HTML publishing
  - And 15+ more

### 3. **The Sounds** 🔊
- ✅ **agent-sims-hook.sh** - "working", "thinking", "offline" status sounds
- ✅ **notify.sh** - Notification handler
- ✅ **noisy-claude** - Sound feedback for Claude Code sessions
  - These hooks make it feel alive and responsive

### 4. **Your Context** 📁
- ✅ **Project instructions** - CLAUDE.md files with our agreements
- ✅ **Settings** - Permissions, MCP servers, API configuration
- ✅ **Commands** - Custom command definitions

### 5. **Your Integrations** 🔌
- ✅ **MCP Server configs** (you'll reinstall the servers themselves):
  - vault-mcp - Your knowledge vault
  - figma-mcp - Figma integration
  - gworkspace-mcp - Google Workspace
- ✅ **Shopify API proxy** - Your custom API endpoint configuration

## What Needs Reconfiguring (Quick)

🔄 **~5 minutes of setup on new machine:**

1. **API credentials** - For security, not included
   ```bash
   /opt/dev/bin/user/devx llm-gateway print-token --key
   ```

2. **MCP servers** - Install the packages (configs already set)
   ```bash
   # Your vault, Figma, and Google Workspace servers
   ```

3. **Hook permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.claude/*.sh
   chmod +x ~/Documents/MyEP/projects/noisy-claude/*.sh
   ```
