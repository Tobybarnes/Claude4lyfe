# Agent Team Feedback Patterns

This document captures proven feedback patterns from the advisory team. Use these as reference when reviewing weekly updates.

## 🎯 Executive Coach - VP Positioning

### Common Gaps to Watch For

**Too Operational, Not Strategic Enough**
- ❌ "Kazden: Prototype updates, file renames"
- ✅ "We're positioning Shopify's AI-first commerce strategy through Autopilot, targeting $X merchant segment by Editions"

**Underselling Impact**
- ❌ "Jeff had a WIP review"
- ✅ "I facilitated strategic clarity for SLT on multi-channel architecture"

**Missing "Why It Matters"**
- ❌ "Autopilot is progressing"
- ✅ "Autopilot targets 2M+ merchants, projected $XM ARR impact, positions Shopify in AI-first commerce"

**Team Attribution vs. Your Leadership**
- ❌ "Chelsea mapped out options"
- ✅ "I'm driving architectural alignment across channels to enable coherent agent UX"

### VP-Level Reframe Checklist

- [ ] Lead with strategic impact, not project updates
- [ ] Show YOUR role in unblocking architectural decisions
- [ ] Demonstrate cross-functional alignment and leadership
- [ ] Connect work to broader company missions and strategy
- [ ] Highlight executive engagement (Tobi, SLT) as strategic wins, not just meetings

## 🎨 Creative Director - Visual Excellence

### Common Gaps to Watch For

**No Visual Storytelling**
- ❌ Text-only descriptions of design work
- ✅ Hero images, screenshots, visual previews of key wins

**Buried Wins**
- ❌ "Successful progress update with Tobi" as item #1 in a list
- ✅ Tobi engagement featured prominently with visual callout

**Wall of Text**
- ❌ No visual hierarchy beyond headers
- ✅ Visual callouts, featured sections, gallery integration

**"Tell Don't Show" for Design Work**
- ❌ "Working on campaigns design"
- ✅ Screenshots of campaigns work, visual progression, craft excellence

### Visual Excellence Checklist

- [ ] Lead with hero image or key visual for biggest win
- [ ] Add screenshots/previews of work being discussed
- [ ] Use visual callouts for high-impact items (Tobi engagement, SLT reviews)
- [ ] Gallery integrated throughout, not just appendix
- [ ] Visual hierarchy matches importance of content

## 📊 Product Ops - Data & Impact

### Common Gaps to Watch For

**No Metrics**
- ❌ "Autopilot is progressing"
- ✅ "Autopilot targets 2M+ merchants, projected $XM ARR impact"

**Missing Business Context**
- ❌ "Shop Campaigns eligibility work"
- ✅ "Shop Campaigns eligibility friction affects X% of merchants, reducing $Y in potential ad spend"

**Vague Assertions**
- ❌ "Design was 7/10" (Who scored? Based on what?)
- ✅ Remove unsubstantiated claims or add proper context

**Vault Links Without Data**
- ❌ Just linking to Vault project
- ✅ Pull actual product metrics, user impact, adoption data

### Data Excellence Checklist

- [ ] Every big rock has quantifiable impact (merchant reach, revenue, adoption)
- [ ] Business context is clear (market opportunity, strategic rationale)
- [ ] Vault data is accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] Metrics connect to outcomes Carl cares about
- [ ] Remove assertions without evidence

## 🎯 Design Principles - Shopify Alignment

### Common Gaps to Watch For

**Missing Design Craft Narrative**
- ❌ Process updates ("Burst recap," "file renames")
- ✅ Design excellence, craft decisions, merchant impact

**Too Process-Focused**
- ❌ "Had a review," "updated files," "team sync"
- ✅ Strategic design decisions and their rationale

**No Merchant Impact Story**
- ❌ "Working on design"
- ✅ "How this design work drives merchant success and outcomes"

**Team Visibility Too Granular**
- ❌ Individual OOO status, task-level details
- ✅ Team capability, strategic contributions, design leadership

### Carl Wants to See

- [ ] How design work drives merchant outcomes
- [ ] Design leadership and principles in action
- [ ] Strategic design decisions and rationale
- [ ] Team's craft excellence (not just activity)
- [ ] Alignment with Shopify design maturity and values

## 🔥 Top 5 Immediate Improvements

### 1. Lead with Strategic Impact, Not Project Updates

**Before:**
> Growth Agent is now Autopilot & Successful progress update with Tobi

**After:**
> Autopilot: Positioned Shopify's AI Commerce Strategy with Tobi - April 15 GA targeting 2M+ merchants

### 2. Add Business Metrics and Context

**Pattern:**
Every big rock needs:
- Merchant reach (X merchants affected)
- Revenue impact (projected $Y impact)
- Strategic rationale (why this matters to Shopify)

### 3. Show the Work Visually

**Pattern:**
- Add hero images for top wins
- Feature design work, don't just describe it
- Make the update look as good as the work you're showcasing

### 4. Elevate Your Leadership Voice

**Before:**
> Chelsea mapped out options

**After:**
> I'm driving architectural alignment across channels to enable coherent agent UX

### 5. Reduce Operational Noise

**Remove:**
- File renames
- OOO status
- Individual task details
- Process updates

**Focus:**
- Strategic decisions
- Cross-functional leadership
- Design impact
- Merchant outcomes

## Multi-Source Synthesis

**New Capability:** Weekly updates now pull from 5 data sources:
1. **Slack** - Team channel updates
2. **Google Email** - Carl feedback, SLT communications
3. **Signal MD Files** - Strategic observations logged
4. **Vault** - Project data, milestones, reviews
5. **Figma** - Design work and artifacts

### Why Multi-Source Matters

**Single-source updates miss strategic context:**
- ❌ "Team shipped Autopilot UX" (just Slack)
- ✅ "Autopilot positioned in Tobi email as AI-first commerce priority (Email), connects to 'agentic UI patterns' signal from Jan 15 (Signal), shipping against Vault project #8590 (Vault), designs reviewed with Carl last week (Figma link)"

### Synthesis Patterns

**Connect the dots across sources:**
- Email from Carl + Slack update = Strategic priority with execution progress
- Vault milestone + Signal observation = Why this work matters now
- Figma link + Vault project = Visual proof of strategic work
- Slack discussion + Email feedback = Leadership engagement and team response

**Example:**
```markdown
### Autopilot: Positioned Shopify's AI-First Commerce Strategy
- sources: Email (Tobi, Feb 7), Slack (#proj-growth-agent), Vault (#8590), Signal (AI/agentic-ui-patterns), Figma (Autopilot UX R2)
- why: Tobi's email positioned this as strategic bet on AI commerce. Connects to broader agentic UI trend we're tracking. Team delivered on milestone 3 days early.
```

## Quick Self-Review Questions

Before publishing, ask:

1. **Strategic Impact:** Does each Big Rock show strategic value, not just progress?
2. **Your Leadership:** Is YOUR contribution visible, or just team activity?
3. **Business Metrics:** Does each item have quantifiable impact?
4. **Visual Excellence:** Does the update showcase the design work visually?
5. **Merchant Impact:** Is it clear how this helps merchants succeed?
6. **Carl's Priorities:** Would Carl see what he cares about (design excellence, merchant outcomes, strategic contribution)?
7. **Operational Noise:** Have I removed task-level details that dilute strategic narrative?

## Example: Before/After Big Rock

### ❌ Before (Operational)

```markdown
### 1. Growth Agent is now Autopilot & Successful progress update with Tobi
- status: in-progress
- pillar: Innovation
- why: Kazden: Prototype updates, file renames, burst recap. Had a good sync with Tobi. Design was 7/10.
- vault: [link]
```

### ✅ After (Strategic)

```markdown
### 1. Autopilot: Positioned Shopify's AI-First Commerce Strategy with Tobi
- status: shipping April 15
- pillar: Innovation
- impact: Targeting 2M+ merchants, projected $15M ARR. First agentic commerce experience at Shopify scale.
- leadership: I drove architectural alignment across Marketing Channels, facilitated strategic clarity with Tobi and SLT on AI commerce positioning. Unblocked key UX decisions for coherent agent experience.
- merchant value: Enables merchants to automate marketing strategy and execution, reducing time-to-market for campaigns by 80%.
- vault: [link]
- preview: [screenshot of Autopilot UX]
```

**Key Differences:**
- ✅ Strategic framing (AI-first commerce strategy)
- ✅ Business metrics (2M merchants, $15M ARR, 80% time reduction)
- ✅ Leadership visibility (drove alignment, facilitated, unblocked)
- ✅ Merchant impact (clear value proposition)
- ✅ Visual preview (screenshot)
- ❌ Removed operational noise (file renames, task updates)
