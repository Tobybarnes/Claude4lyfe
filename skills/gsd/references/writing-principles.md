# Shopify Writing Principles

## Everyone at Shopify is a writer, just like everyone at Shopify works on product.

Emails, Slack messages, project briefs, investment plans, blog posts, product content, error messages… we write a lot. Few of us identify as writers, and yet we all use the written word to communicate every day. This will only increase as we add more products and more teammates around the world.

Shopify benefits from us becoming better writers. The clearer we communicate, the less time we waste, and the more time we spend making commerce better for everyone.

We live in an age of mass communication where mastery of the written word is a superpower. Learning to write clearly and concisely is not only beneficial for every aspect of your life, it's also tons of fun. Seriously!

These principles are simple guidelines to help you become a better writer. After learning them, your writing will improve. With practice, you'll get even better and writing will become a fun challenge instead of a dreaded exercise.

Good luck!

## Follow Shopify style

People at Shopify have already made a lot of good decisions about writing. Default to our [Polaris product content guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/product-content) for spelling, capitalization, or formatting questions. Here are a few common examples:

 -  **ecommerce:** Not "e-commerce," "Ecommerce," or "eCommerce"
 -  **internet:**  Not "Internet."
 -  **Use the Oxford comma:**  Add a final comma to a list of three or more items: "lions,  tigers, and bears."
 -  **Use sentence case for titles:**  Capitalize the first word of a title, not every word. "Like this one here" instead of "Like This One Here."
 -  **Put only one space between sentences:**   Not like we just did here. &nbsp;See how fat that gap is?
 -  **Use American English spelling:**  "Realize," not "realise." (yes, the internet is Americanized English, even for Canadian companies...)

## Write simple

Our mission is to make commerce better for everyone. That means we need to use simple language that is clear.

 -  **Remove idioms:**  The phrase "kick the bucket" means death to English speakers, but it means nothing to those learning the language. It doesn't translate well, either.
 -  **Curb acronyms:**  People without the right context will have no idea what you're talking about. If you must use one, spell out the term on first reference. For example: "Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV)." Read [Shopify's allowed-listed acronyms](https://vault.shopify.io/docs/shopifolk-essentials/196-Policies---Guidelines/Guidelines/1456-Rest-in-Peace-Acronyms) that are acceptable for moderate use.
 -  **Avoid lingo:**  Lingo is the evil bastard child of idioms and acronyms. It's by definition exclusionary because only the in-field group knows how to parse the words and their meaning. Don't.
These three are crutches that you need to avoid. What you can do is set up metaphors that are evocative to your audience and 'paint the picture'.
 -  **Make heavy use of [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink):**  Shopify is a high-context company. We tackle complex issues, and it takes a lot of time and words to simplify everything. If you refer to another topic or project, provide a link to where your reader can learn more. Links are the killer feature of the web browser world, use them more than you might otherwise.
 -  **Avoid "at Shopify":** the ideal count of "at Shopify"s in a memo is 0. Sometimes it can be 1, if it really helps. It can never be more than 1.

## Vary the length of your sentences

Use a variety of short, medium, and long sentences. Short sentences are a powerful way to drive home a moment of clarity. Long ones can build context, escalate important points, and even create suspense. Make it musical.

Author Gary Provost captures this concept in his book, 100 Ways to Improve Your Writing:

>  _"This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety._
>  _Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage [them] with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals—sounds that say listen to this, it is important._
>  _So write with a combination of short, medium, and long sentences. Create a sound that pleases the reader's ear. Don't just write words. Write music."_

 -  **Add line spaces between paragraphs:**  Instead of indenting a new paragraph, enter a line of blank space to provide breathing room between thoughts.
 -  **Add emphasis where appropriate:**  Bold or italicize words to highlight important content. This can be distracting, so use this strategy sparingly.


## Write in an active, positive voice

This principle is a bit more technical, but learning to write actively and positively will improve your writing flow.

 **Example: Write in an active voice**

Put the subject of the sentence first, followed by the action they take. This easily lets the reader know who you're talking about.

For maximum impact, write about someone doing something, and not something being done to someone or something.

❌  **Passive voice:**  "It was decided that the idea should be presented at Town Hall."

✅  **Active voice:**  "They decided to present their idea at Town Hall."

There are exceptions to this guideline. Sometimes the passive voice can be used for effect. The passive voice can draw attention or empathy to your sentence's object, instead of the subject or the action they take. For example, when writing about something concrete like an Investment Plan, lead with that instead of hiding it in the middle of the sentence, like this:

✅  **Passive voice:**  "Investment Plans are written by each Product and Service Line to demonstrate their priorities for the quarter ahead."

❌  **Active voice:**   "Each Product and Service Line writes their Investment Plan to demonstrate their priorities for the quarter ahead."

In this case, the passive voice helps explain what an Investment Plan is, instead of focusing on the people writing them.

 **Example: Write in a positive voice**

Instead of focusing on what your subject or topic didn't do, try to frame it in a way that highlights what they did do. This removes a layer of complexity, and makes it easier for your reader to follow. For example:

❌  **Negative voice:**  "The writer didn't do a good job."

✅  **Positive voice:**  "The writer did a poor job."

## Polish

Polish is one of [Shopify's Product Principles](../1446-Product-Principles.md), and is also a requirement of good writing. Your work should be appropriately edited before publishing, just like your code should be reviewed before pushing it to production.

The Broken Window Theory described in Shopify's Product Principles also applies to writing well. Quality is essential. If someone sees one typo or grammatical error, they might make a sweeping assessment about the credibility of your writing. Always produce the best user experience possible, whether it's within a product or a piece of writing.

The amount of time you spend on a piece of writing should be directly proportionate to the impact it will have. To determine how important a piece of writing is, consider the size of the audience, how formal it will be, and whether it's for an internal or an external audience.

| Audience size | Internal audience | External audience | Memo length |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Small         | Minimal editing  | Moderate editing  | Minimal length |
| Medium        | Moderate editing | Maximum editing   | Minimal length |
| Large         | Moderate editing | Maximum editing   | Minimal length |

In terms of formality, follow your gut, but never be too formal. The only exceptions are official documents such as SEC Filings or legal briefs which have their own language and are probably not reading this for guidance.

There are two excellent ways to improve almost any memo ever:

 - **Take the second to last paragraph, make it the first, then cut everything that's no longer needed. Almost always works, try it.**
 - **Ask yourself: would I have explained this problem to a friend in a bar the same way if they asked me what problem i'm trying to solve? if no, replace the memo with the explanation you would have given, It's better.**
