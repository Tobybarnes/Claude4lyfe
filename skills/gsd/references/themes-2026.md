# Shopify Themes 2026

Use this reference when reviewing proposals and projects for strategic alignment.

---

## The Strategic Context

**AI is the greatest platform shift in the history of technology.** Shopify is a bridge company: we take the raw power that technology makes possible and cast it into tools for millions of merchants.

**Our job remains the same: increase the rate of successful entrepreneurship on the internet.**

The AI platform shift is forcing every software company to reinvent itself. **"Agentic commerce" is suddenly the main event.** Everyone knows the value of our space now and everyone is coming for our merchants.

---

## Meta Theme: Shopify is the Foundation of Agentic Commerce

**Therefore**: In 2026, Shopify becomes synonymous with agentic commerce.

Agentic commerce is more than "a bot that can click a buy button." It's commerce becoming available as a capability to any interface that can hold a conversation, make a plan, and take actions:
- Shopping inside search
- Inside assistants
- Inside productivity tools
- Inside feeds
- Inside Shop App
- And places we haven't named yet

**It is absolutely existential that the "Shopify of Agentic Commerce" will be... Shopify.**

---

## Theme 1: Catalog — Discoverable Everywhere

> *Merchants say: "Shopify makes my products discoverable everywhere"*

**Therefore**: We make Catalog the world's best commerce graph and feed it to every agent and surface that matters.

In the agentic world, distribution isn't a list of channels you manually manage. It's surfaces that understand your business well enough to recommend it, compare it, and transact on it.

**Key points for reviewers:**
- Catalog is expanding from 250B Shopify products to indexing all products everywhere
- Massive enrichment: taxonomy, attributes, embeddings for concepts like "formality" or "how fashionable"
- First time search infrastructure has been custom-built for commerce
- **Catalog infrastructure will be Shopify's most important asset over the next decade**

**Alignment check**: Does this proposal strengthen our product data, improve discoverability, or extend where merchants' products can be found?

---

## Theme 2: Trust — Identity, Payments, Promises

> *Buyers say: "Shopify knows me, I trust its merchants, and it has Shop Pay"*

**Therefore**: We make identity, payments, and promises work everywhere — Shop Login, Shop Pay, Shop Promise — to keep raising the trust bar.

**Trust isn't warm fuzzies — it's the currency that makes commerce flow.**

**Key points for reviewers:**
- Shop Pay improves conversion by up to 50%, with 5% lift even when not used
- Goal: Shop Pay as the world's most recognizable wallet, found wherever buying happens
- Expand Shop Promise and Shop Identity beyond Online Store
- Identity becomes an MCP into what buyers want for personalized experiences
- Trust battery: each good experience charges it, enabling pure confidence

**Alignment check**: Does this proposal strengthen trust primitives, improve conversion, or extend Shop Pay/Promise/Identity reach?

---

## Theme 3: Shop App — The Shopping Destination

> *Merchants and Buyers say: "Shop is the single best shopping destination"*

**Therefore**: Shop App becomes the shopping companion buyers seek out constantly, where discovery, tracking, and buying come together.

**Key points for reviewers:**
- 150M+ registered Shop users
- Not a marketplace (we don't pit merchants against each other on price)
- Not a feed full of ads
- Something new: products find you, discovery feels like entertainment, buying is frictionless
- For merchants: distribution channel they didn't have to build or pay for

**The flywheel**: Shop Pay convinced buyers Shopify checkout is better. Shop App can convince them Shopify discovery is better. When merchants join partly for the buyer network, we've built something that compounds.

**Alignment check**: Does this proposal strengthen Shop App as a destination, improve buyer engagement, or enhance merchant distribution through Shop?

---

## Theme 4: Platform APIs — Best Products, Best APIs

> *Platform owners say: "Shopify has the best products with the best APIs"*

**Therefore**: We integrate with every platform, set prevailing standards/protocols, and get merchants' products in the best converting channels — agentic and beyond.

**Strategy**: Merchants post products to our global Catalog, then we federate it by API or feed to every major internet company for inclusion in their surfaces.

**Key points for reviewers:**
- Transition from push (channels) to pull (agents pull data via API)
- The internet needs a product API so all agents can pull — our job to build it
- Compliance: MoR work shields merchants, Shopify vouches for them on third-party platforms
- Infrastructure: web components, native components, protocols, SDKs for rendering products/checkouts anywhere

**Alignment check**: Does this proposal make it easier for platforms to integrate Shopify, improve our APIs, or help merchants sell through more surfaces?

---

## Theme 5: Sidekick — The n+1 Employee

> *Entrepreneurs say: "Shopify has Sidekick"*

**Therefore**: Sidekick becomes the new interaction model for running a business: plan, delegate, execute, review. The Admin becomes Sidekick-centric, malleable, bespoke.

**The promise is entrepreneurship leverage**: small teams operating like much larger ones.

**Key points for reviewers:**
- Not a demo or experiment — a new part of the product
- Evolution: from good advisor (answers questions) to staff member (gets to work)
- Sidekick Pulse: notifies merchants when something can be improved or is going wrong
- "Sell for Me" setting: self-driving mode within merchant-set guardrails
- **Smart but safe**: reversible actions, shows its work, propose→preview→confirm→execute

**Sidekick is trustworthy because:**
- Takes actions through safe, legible interfaces
- Makes changes that are reversible
- Shows reasoning, not just answers
- Merchants stay in control, always

**Alignment check**: Does this proposal enhance Sidekick's capabilities, improve merchant autonomy through AI, or reduce drudgery while keeping humans in control?

**What Sidekick is NOT:**
- Internal AI tooling for Shopifolk (developer tools, internal productivity)
- General AI/ML infrastructure not directly serving merchants
- AI features in non-Admin merchant surfaces (those may fit other themes)

## Using Themes in Reviews

When reviewing proposals, ask:

### Strong Theme Alignment
- Does this directly advance one or more themes?
- Is the theme connection explicit in the proposal?
- Does it strengthen our position in agentic commerce?

### Weak or Missing Alignment
- Is this important work that doesn't fit themes? (That's okay, but should be acknowledged)
- Could this proposal be reframed to better connect with themes?
- Is this actively working against theme priorities?

### Red Flags
- Proposals that add complexity without advancing themes
- Work that fragments rather than unifies (e.g., building outside Catalog when Catalog should be extended)
- Projects that conflict with agentic commerce direction

---

## Internal Tooling & Work That Doesn't Fit Themes

Not all valuable work directly advances merchant-facing themes. Internal tooling, developer productivity, and infrastructure supporting Shopifolk are important but should be evaluated differently.

### Examples of Work Outside Themes
- **Internal AI tools** (developer assistants, productivity tools for employees) — NOT Sidekick
- **Build/CI infrastructure** — NOT Platform APIs (unless it directly improves merchant-facing APIs)
- **Internal dashboards and admin tools for Shopifolk** — NOT Shop App
- **Developer experience improvements** — may enable theme work but isn't theme work itself

### How to Evaluate Non-Theme Work
1. **Acknowledge it's not theme-aligned** — this is okay, don't force-fit
2. **Assess indirect value** — does it enable theme work to happen faster/better?
3. **Apply standard criteria** — clear outcomes, measurable success, realistic scope
4. **Be explicit about the value chain** — "This internal tool helps teams X, Y, Z ship theme work faster because..."

### Common Misalignments to Flag
- **Calling internal AI "Sidekick"** — Sidekick is specifically merchant-facing AI in the Admin
- **Claiming Platform APIs for internal tooling** — Platform APIs are about external developers and platforms integrating with Shopify
- **Stretching "Catalog" to mean any data work** — Catalog is product data for commerce discovery
