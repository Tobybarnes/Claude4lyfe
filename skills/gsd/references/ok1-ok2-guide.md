# OK1 and OK2 Review Guide

This reference explains the GSD review structure and what reviewers expect.

---

## Review Structure

### OK1 Reviewers
- **Assigned by**: Team's review plan
- **Maximum**: 3 reviewers
- **Role**: Subject matter experts who evaluate the proposal in detail
- **Typical**: Senior engineers, product leads, domain experts

### OK2 Reviewers
- **Assigned by**: Proposal's product and project type
- **Maximum**: 1 reviewer
- **Role**: Product-level aimer who ensures strategic alignment
- **Not editable**: Automatically assigned based on product

### OK-Inform
- **Purpose**: Awareness, not approval
- **No blocking power**: They can comment but can't block approval
- **Use for**: Stakeholders who should know, but don't need to approve

## How Reviews Work

### Approval Flow
1. Proposal submitted
2. OK1 and OK2 reviewers assigned
3. Reviewers evaluate and comment
4. **If ALL approve** → Project is created
5. **If ANY decline** → Proposal returns to draft
6. **If no activity for 2 weeks** → Marked as declined

### The "Hell Yes" Standard

> "Shopify has a million things to do. Many great ideas won't be right for us right now, so we shouldn't spend time on high fidelity proposals in an environment where the default will be no, unless it's a resounding 'Hell Yes!'"

Reviewers aren't looking for reasons to approve. They're looking for **compelling reasons that make approval obvious**.

## What OK1 Reviewers Evaluate

### Technical & Domain Expertise
- Is the proposed approach sound?
- Are there technical risks not addressed?
- Does the team have the capability?
- Is the scope appropriate?

### Feasibility
- Is the timeline realistic?
- Are dependencies manageable?
- Are estimates reasonable?

### Quality of Thinking
- Is the problem clearly defined?
- Are success criteria measurable?
- Are alternatives considered?

## What OK2 Reviewers Evaluate

### Strategic Alignment
- Does this advance the product's goals?
- Is this the right priority for now?
- Does it align with themes and mission?

### Portfolio View
- How does this fit with other work in the product?
- Are there duplications or conflicts?
- Is this the right team for this work?

### Resource Allocation
- Is this the best use of these resources?
- What's the opportunity cost?

## Making Reviews Easy

### Pre-Read
- Send materials **24 hours before** if booking a sync
- Don't make reviewers discover context

### Clear Ask
- Be explicit about what you need
- "I need approval to proceed to Build"
- "I need feedback on the technical approach"

### No New Artifacts
- Use existing documents, Figma files, code
- Don't create special materials just for review
- Walk through what you have

### Video Helps
- Short video (≤3 min) explaining the proposal
- Makes complex proposals easier to understand
- Show, don't just tell

---

## Common Reasons for Decline

### 1. Unclear Problem Statement
"I don't understand what problem this solves."

### 2. Vague Success Criteria
"How will we know if this worked?"

### 3. Unrealistic Timeline
"This seems optimistic given the scope."

### 4. Missing Alignment
"How does this fit with our priorities?"

### 5. Unaddressed Risks
"What happens if X goes wrong?"

### 6. No Alternatives Considered
"Is this the only way to solve this?"

### 7. Too Big
"Can this be broken into smaller pieces?"

## Review Types by Phase

| Phase Transition | What's Evaluated |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Proposal → Prototype** | Problem clarity, scope, team readiness |
| **Prototype → Build** | Learnings, tech design, estimates |
| **Build → Release** | Quality, operational readiness, GTM |
| **Release → Done** | Outcomes, learnings, cleanup |

---

## Getting Feedback Before Review

Don't wait for formal review to get feedback:

1. **Multifecta Review**: PM, UX, Eng, Data review internally first
2. **Draft Sharing**: Share proposal draft with potential reviewers informally
3. **Office Hours**: Use product office hours for early feedback
4. **Slack Check**: Quick sanity check with experienced people

**Better to get "this needs work" informally than a formal decline.**

---

## After Decline

If your proposal is declined:

1. **Understand why**: Ask for specific feedback if not provided
2. **Don't take it personally**: It's about the proposal, not you
3. **Address concerns**: Revise based on feedback
4. **Resubmit when ready**: Proposals can be resubmitted after revision
5. **Learn for next time**: What would you do differently?

## Subproject Reviews

When proposing a subproject:
- Parent project champion is the required reviewer
- Makes sense when work supports existing approved project
- Lower bar since parent project already approved
- Still needs clear scope and success criteria
