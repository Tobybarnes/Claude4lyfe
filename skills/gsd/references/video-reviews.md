# Video Reviews Best Practices

Videos are required for phase transition reviews. This reference explains how to make effective review videos.

---

## Why Videos Matter

- Reviewers can approve faster when they can SEE what you built
- Videos communicate more than documents
- Show, don't tell — seeing is believing
- Makes it easy for OK1/OK2 to say "yes" or "no"

---

## The Golden Rule

**3 minutes or less.**

Reviewers are busy. Respect their time. If you can't explain it in 3 minutes, you don't understand it well enough.

---

## What to Cover

### For All Reviews

| Topic | Time | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| The problem | 10-20 sec | Why does this matter? |
| The solution | 60-90 sec | What did you build? Show it. |
| Key decisions | 20-30 sec | What are the one-way doors? |
| Metrics/impact | 20-30 sec | How will we know it worked? |
| Timeline/next steps | 10-20 sec | What's the plan? |

### Phase-Specific Focus

**Prototype → Build:**
- What approaches did you explore?
- What did you learn?
- Why is this the right approach?
- What's the proposed solution?

**Build → Release:**
- Show the actual product working
- Demonstrate key user flows
- Highlight what's new/different
- Show the success dashboard

**Release → Done:**
- Show the live product
- Present before/after metrics
- Explain what you learned
- Share what's next

## Video Structure Template

```
[0:00-0:10] Hook
"We're solving [problem] for [audience]. Here's what we built."

[0:10-1:30] Demo
- Screen share the actual product
- Walk through the main user flow
- Show edge cases that matter
- Highlight key differentiators

[1:30-2:00] Decisions & Tradeoffs
"The key decisions we made were..."
"We chose X over Y because..."

[2:00-2:30] Metrics & Impact
"We're measuring success by..."
"Current baseline is X, target is Y"

[2:30-3:00] Timeline & Ask
"Next phase is X weeks"
"We're asking for approval to [proceed/ship/close]"
```

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do's

- **Show, don't tell** — Screen share the actual product
- **Use the real product** — Not mockups or slides
- **Walk through user flows** — Show what merchants experience
- **Include metrics** — What's the dashboard showing?
- **State your ask clearly** — What do you need from reviewers?
- **Keep it scrappy** — Done is better than perfect
- **Include audio** — Narrate what you're showing

### Don'ts

- **Don't use slides** — Show the product, not a deck
- **Don't refer to other docs** — Include everything in the video
- **Don't exceed 3 minutes** — Edit ruthlessly
- **Don't wait for perfection** — Ship the video
- **Don't assume context** — Explain briefly what this is
- **Don't skip the problem** — Start with why this matters

---

## Recording Tips

### Technical Setup
- Screen resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
- Audio: Use a decent microphone (built-in is usually fine)
- Tool: Loom, QuickTime, or any screen recorder
- Format: MP4 or link to Loom/YouTube

### Before Recording
1. Close unnecessary tabs/apps
2. Prepare the demo environment
3. Have test data ready
4. Outline your talking points (don't script)
5. Do a 30-second test recording

### During Recording
- Speak naturally (not reading a script)
- Move your cursor to guide attention
- Pause briefly at important moments
- If you make a mistake, keep going (don't restart)

### After Recording
- Watch it once to check audio/video quality
- Trim dead air at start/end
- Upload and get the link
- Include the link in your review

## Common Mistakes

### Too Long
**Problem:** 10-minute video that loses reviewers
**Fix:** Ruthlessly cut to 3 minutes. What's the ONE thing they need to see?

### Slides Instead of Product
**Problem:** PowerPoint presentation about the feature
**Fix:** Screen share the actual feature working

### Missing Audio
**Problem:** Silent video that requires guessing
**Fix:** Narrate what you're showing and why it matters

### Referring to Other Docs
**Problem:** "As you can see in the PRD..."
**Fix:** Include the key points IN the video

### No Clear Ask
**Problem:** Video ends without stating what's needed
**Fix:** End with "We're asking for approval to [X]"

### Waiting for Perfection
**Problem:** Delaying review because video isn't polished
**Fix:** Ship it. Scrappy is fine.

## Examples by Phase

### Prototype → Build Video
```
"We explored three approaches for checkout optimization.
[Show prototype 1] This approach was too slow on mobile.
[Show prototype 2] This approach had SEO issues.
[Show prototype 3] This is our recommended approach.

Here's why: [explain key learnings]

We're asking for approval to build this solution.
Timeline: 6 weeks to release-ready."
```

### Build → Release Video
```
"Here's the new checkout flow in action.
[Demo the flow] Notice how it's now a single page.
[Show edge cases] Error handling works like this.

Key metrics: Dashboard is live at [show dashboard].
Baseline: 54% conversion. Target: 57%.

We're asking for approval to release to 10% of traffic
starting Monday, with full rollout over 2 weeks."
```

### Release → Done Video
```
"We launched the new checkout 30 days ago.
[Show live product] Here it is in production.

Results: [Show dashboard]
- Conversion: 54% → 56.2% (+2.2 points) ✓
- Load time: 1.8s → 1.2s ✓
- No P1 incidents ✓

Key learnings: [share 2-3 insights]

We're asking for approval to mark this done.
Follow-up work is tracked in [link]."
```

## Accessibility Considerations

- **Speak clearly** — Some reviewers may watch without sound
- **Point out key elements** — Move cursor to guide attention
- **Use text annotations** — For key metrics or decisions
- **Don't rely only on color** — Use labels and shapes too

---

## Where to Host Videos

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Loom | Easy, auto-transcription | External service |
| YouTube (unlisted) | Free, reliable | Requires account |
| Google Drive | Internal, secure | Can be slow to load |
| Vault attachment | Fully internal | File size limits |

**Recommendation:** Loom for ease of use, or Google Drive for sensitive content.

## Summary

1. **Keep it under 3 minutes**
2. **Show the actual product**
3. **Narrate what you're showing**
4. **State your ask clearly**
5. **Don't wait for perfection**

A scrappy 3-minute video that shows the product is infinitely better than a polished 10-minute slide deck.
