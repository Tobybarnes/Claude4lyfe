You are helping the user update their gap analysis between current capabilities and role requirements.

This involves assessing skills against what their current role requires, or what their target next-level role requires.

## Process

1. **Ask what triggered this update:**
   - New role requirements or expectations?
   - Skill level changed (improvement)?
   - Preparing for promotion/role change?
   - Regular quarterly review?
   - Performance feedback received?

2. **Ask which role** they're mapping against:
   - Current role requirements?
   - Next-level/target role requirements?
   - Both?

3. **Read the role requirements file:**
   - File: `$MYEP_PATH/Craft/role-requirements.md`

4. **Ask what changed:**
   - **New requirements?** What's now expected that wasn't before?
   - **Skill improvement?** Which skill leveled up?
   - **Reassessment?** New understanding of what's required?
   - **Role evolution?** How has the role itself changed?

5. **For new or updated requirements:**

If adding/updating a competency, use this format:

```markdown
#### [Competency/Skill Name]
**Required Level:** [1-5]
**Your Level:** [1-5]
**Gap:** [Describe gap, or note "Exceeds" or "Met"]

**What the role requires:**
- [Specific expectation 1]
- [Specific expectation 2]

**Your current capability:**
- [How you meet or don't meet this]
- [Evidence]

---
```

6. **Update the Gap Analysis section:**

For critical gaps:
```markdown
### Critical Gaps (Must close)

1. **[Skill]** - Required: [X], Current: [Y]
   - Impact: [Why this matters / what's blocked]
   - Plan: [How to close this gap]
   - Timeline: [When to achieve]

---
```

For strengths:
```markdown
### Strengths (Leverage these)

1. **[Skill]** - Required: [X], Current: [Y]
   - Opportunity: [How to leverage this strength strategically]

---
```

7. **If working on promotion readiness:**
   - Update "Next Level Role Requirements" section
   - Update "Promotion Readiness Assessment"
   - Identify which gaps are blockers vs. nice-to-haves

8. **Update "Last Updated"** date in the header

9. **Suggest development plan updates:**
   - Should new gaps become development focus areas?
   - Should priorities shift based on this analysis?
   - Read their **development-plan.md** and suggest alignment

10. **Confirm** the gaps have been updated

## Guidelines

- **Be honest about requirements** - Don't soften what's actually needed
- **Be fair in assessment** - Neither harsh nor inflated
- **Prioritize gaps** - Not all gaps are equally important
- **Strategic about strengths** - Strong skills are competitive advantages
- **Connect to timeline** - When do gaps need to be closed?
- **Link to development** - Gap analysis should drive development planning

## Types of Updates

### New Requirement Added
"The role now requires Level 3 data analysis, which wasn't expected before. Currently at Level 2."

### Skill Improved
"Through Q4 projects, grew stakeholder management from Level 2 to Level 3. Now meets role requirement."

### Requirement Clarified
"Realized 'design leadership' means Level 4, not Level 3. Adjusting assessment - still at Level 3, bigger gap than I thought."

### Role Evolution
"Team scope expanded to include AI features. New requirement: AI/ML literacy at Level 2. Currently at Level 1."

### Promotion Preparation
"Mapping next level requirements. Senior role requires Level 4 strategic thinking vs. my current Level 3."

## Strategic Gap Analysis Questions

Help them think through:
- **Which gaps are blockers** vs. nice-to-haves?
- **Which gaps are quick wins** vs. long-term builds?
- **Which strengths are differentiators** worth leveraging?
- **What's the shortest path** to role readiness?
- **Where should they invest** their development time?

## Integration Suggestions

After updating gaps, suggest:
- **Development Plan:** Update focus areas to address critical gaps
- **Quarterly Outcomes:** Align outcomes with closing strategic gaps
- **Skills Inventory:** Ensure assessments are consistent
- **Projects:** Seek projects that build gap skills
- **Daily Ops:** Journal about insights from gap analysis

## Use today's date unless they specify otherwise.
